# MyHome
This is the repository for automations I use in my home. I have decided to make it public so that users of [HaKafkaNet](https://github.com/leosperry/ha-kafka-net) can see more complex working examples.

[This](https://github.com/leosperry/MyHome/tree/main/MyHome/Automations) folder has my working automations. Some of the automations rely on services found [here](https://github.com/leosperry/MyHome/tree/main/MyHome/Services).

You may also note that I have set up the Transformer and StateManager to run in seperate projects. There are a few benefits to this approach.

Happy Automating!
